# Jiptest for LI-6800 induction data<img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="139" />

The purpose of the package are to help analysis the LI-6800 induction data with JIP test,The method of calculation are from:

> Tsimilli-michael M. Revisiting JIP-test: Aneducative review on concepts, assumptions, approximations, definitions  and terminology[J].Photosynthetica,2019,57 (SI): 90-107.

**As I am not a scientist, so please use with caution, and check the `jip_comp.R` for the calculations. Any feedback will be appreciated. What I am sure to help is the `plot` method to help view the data quickly.**

## install and load

To install: 

```{.r}
devtools::install_github("zhujiedong/jiptest")
```

To load:

```{r}
library(jiptest)
```

## Read the induction files

There are 2 functions for this purpose, one is `read_induction``, to read a single induction excel file:

```{r}
# list all the induction excel files here
files <- list.files("inst/extdata/ojip", full.names = TRUE)
ojip_file1 <- read_induction(files[1])

knitr::kable(head(ojip_file1[,1:4]))
```


Another one is to read all the data files  in batch, and in a tidy data form:

```{r}
all_files <- read_all_induction("inst/extdata/ojip")
knitr::kable(rbind(head(all_files), tail(all_files)))
```

## Calculation

The calculation is done by `jip_test` function, it has a parameter called `use_PAM`, the default value is FALSE, which means it use the continuous fluorescence data by default, if TRUE, it will use the PAM fluorescence.


```{r}
#| message: false

ojip_data_pam <- jip_test(ojip_file1, use_PAM = TRUE) 
ojip_data<- jip_test(ojip_file1) 
knitr::kable(tail(ojip_data))
```
You can also get all the data in a file, there is a column called `SOURCE`, that use the file name which the data come from to distinguish data from different excel files.

```{r}
#| message: false
all_data_continuous<- jip_test(all_files)
all_data_pam <- jip_test(all_files, use_PAM = TRUE)
```

For most normalized calculated parameters, the differences between use_PAM or not are almost zero:

```{r}
paste('difference value of', ojip_data$OJIP_PARAMETERS, "=", ojip_data$VALUES - ojip_data_pam$VALUES)
```


## plot data

It is useful to view all the data through a plot, you can view an OJIP plot by the following ways:

### To view one file

```{r}
#| layout-nrow: 1
plot(ojip_file1, use_PAM = TRUE)
plot(ojip_file1)
```

### To view all files

```{r}
#| layout-nrow: 1
plot(all_files, use_PAM = TRUE)
plot(all_files)
```

Similar to other functions with argument `use_PAM`, you can view the PAM data or the continuous data. The fluorecence data are normalized by:

$$
F=\frac{Ft-Fo}{Fm-Fo}
$$
it will help the Y axis in a range of 0~1.

## PCA analysis



```{r}
library("FactoMineR")
library("factoextra")

pca_df <- jip_pca(all_data_continuous)

# use a short name that easy to distinguish
pca_df$SOURCE <-  c(
    'induction_2020',
    'induction_2018',
    'induction_2020',
    'induction_2017',
    'induction_2017',
    'induction_2017'
  )
```


To help us analyse the results with PCA, a function called `jip_pca` can help us to have a quick view of all the data. There is only one parameter for the function, that is the returned data frame from `jiptest`, to get the data for PCA analysis use continuous light:

```{r}
df <- pca_df[,-1]
final_pca <- PCA(df, graph = FALSE)
fviz_eig(final_pca, addlabels = TRUE)
fviz_pca_var(final_pca)
fviz_pca_ind(final_pca, repel = TRUE, col.ind= pca_df$SOURCE)

```

use PAM:

```{r}

pca_df <- jip_pca(all_data_pam)

df <- pca_df[,-1]
final_pca <- PCA(df, graph = FALSE)
fviz_eig(final_pca, addlabels = TRUE)
fviz_pca_var(final_pca)
fviz_pca_ind(final_pca, repel = TRUE, col.ind= pca_df$SOURCE)
```
