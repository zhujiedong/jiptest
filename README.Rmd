# Jiptest for LI-6800 induction data<img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="139" />

The purpose of the package are to help analysis the LI-6800 induction data with JIP test,The method of calculation are from:

> Tsimilli-michael M. Revisiting JIP-test: Aneducative review on concepts, assumptions, approximations, definitions  and terminology[J].Photosynthetica,2019,57 (SI): 90-107.

**As I am not a scientist, so please use with caution, and check the `jip_comp.R` for the calculations. Any feedback will be appreciated. What I am sure to help is the `plot` method to help view the data quickly.**

## install and load

To install: 

```{.r}
devtools::install_github("zhujiedong/jiptest")
```

To load:

```{r}
library(jiptest)
```

## Read the induction files

There are 2 functions for this purpose, one is `read_induction`, it is meant to read a single induction excel file:

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: flase

# list all the induction excel files here
files <- list.files("inst/extdata/ojip", full.names = TRUE)
ojip_file1 <- read_induction(files[1])

knitr::kable(head(ojip_file1[,1:4]))
```


Another one is a wrap of `read_induction`, just help to read all excel data in a folder, and in a so called tidy data form:

```{r}
all_files <- read_all_induction("inst/extdata/ojip")
knitr::kable(rbind(head(all_files), tail(all_files)))
```

## Calculation

The calculation is done by `jip_test` function, it has a parameter called `use_PAM`, the default value is FALSE, which means it will use the DC  (continuous fluorescence) data by default (recomended as it has high signal/noise ratio), else it will use the AC (PAM) fluorescence.


```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: flase

ojip_data_pam <- jip_test(ojip_file1, use_PAM = TRUE) 
ojip_data<- jip_test(ojip_file1) 
knitr::kable(tail(ojip_data))
```

There is a column called `SOURCE`, which use the file name of each excel file to distinguish where these data come from.


```{r}
#| message: false

all_data_continuous<- jip_test(all_files)
all_data_pam <- jip_test(all_files, use_PAM = TRUE)
```

For most normalized calculated parameters, the differences between use_PAM or not are almost zero:

```{r}
cat(sprintf("difference value of %s are:\n %.3f\n", ojip_data$OJIP_PARAMETERS, ojip_data$VALUES - ojip_data_pam$VALUES))
```


## plot data

It is helpful to view all the data through a plot, you can view an OJIP plot by the following ways:

### To view one file

```{r}
#| layout-nrow: 1
plot(ojip_file1, use_PAM = TRUE)
plot(ojip_file1)
```

### To view all files

```{r}
#| layout-nrow: 1
plot(all_files, use_PAM = TRUE)
plot(all_files)
```

Similar to other functions with argument `use_PAM`, you can view the PAM data or the continuous data. The fluorecence data are normalized by:

$$
F=\frac{Ft-Fo}{Fm-Fo}
$$
it will help the Y axis in a range of 0~1.


Assume my example data (these excel file in the folder of ojip) contains flies of different treatments (actually they belong to different species that test in different years), we assume data from the same year (indicated by the file names) are the same treatment. we should change the column of `SOURCE` in the data file to assign what treatment they really belongs to, to substitute the excel file names when they are imported:

First we should check the file names of `SOURCE`:


```{r}
unique(all_files$SOURCE)
```

Then we can use a function from `jiptest` called `sub_name` to help change the `SOURCE` column to different groups that indicate treatments/replications etc.

```{r}
# use a short name that easy to distinguish
rep_all <-
  c('2020_species',
    '2018_spices',
    '2020_species',
    rep('2017_spices', 3))
df <- all_files
df$SOURCE <- sub_name(df, rep_all)
```

```{r}
#| layout-nrow: 1
plot(all_files)
plot(df)
```

It is more clear to use the 'real groups' between data files to view differences between treatments/replications.


## PCA analysis

To help us analyse the results with PCA, a function called `jip_pca` can help us to have a quick view of all the data. There is only one parameter for the function, that is the returned data frame from `jiptest`, to get the data for PCA analysis use continuous light:

```{r}
library("FactoMineR")
library("factoextra")

pca_df <- jip_pca(all_data_continuous)
                  
```

We can also use the same method to group the imported data from the excel files:

First we should check the file names of `SOURCE` (recommended in case the wrong sequense happend):


```{r}
pca_df$SOURCE
```

Then we can also use `sun_name` to help change the `SOURCE` column to different groups that indicate treatments/replications etc.

```{r}
# use a short name that easy to distinguish
treatment <-
  c('2020_species',
    '2018_spices',
    '2020_species',
    rep('2017_spices', 3))

pca_df$SOURCE <- sub_name(pca_df, treatment)
pca_df$SOURCE
```



```{r}
df <- pca_df[,-1]
final_pca <- PCA(df, graph = FALSE)
fviz_eig(final_pca, addlabels = TRUE)
fviz_pca_var(final_pca)
fviz_pca_ind(final_pca, repel = TRUE, col.ind= pca_df$SOURCE)

```

To use PAM:

```{r}

pca_df <- jip_pca(all_data_pam)

df <- pca_df[,-1]
final_pca <- PCA(df, graph = FALSE)
fviz_eig(final_pca, addlabels = TRUE)
fviz_pca_var(final_pca)
fviz_pca_ind(final_pca, repel = TRUE, col.ind= pca_df$SOURCE)
```
